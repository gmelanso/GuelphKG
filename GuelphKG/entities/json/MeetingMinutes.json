These steps include halting all discretionary spending; employee layoffs and placement of full-time employees on declared emergency leave; halting non-critical hiring; and prioritizing capital projects; andWhereas staff are actively advocating with municipal counterparts to higher levels of government for emergency financing to assist with the projected losses rather than depleting the City\u2019s reserves in one year; andWhereas on July 27, 2020, as part of the federal-provincial Safe Restart Agreement, the Ontario government announced that it has secured up to $4 billion in emergency financial assistance to provide Ontario\u2019s 444 municipalities with the support they need to respond to COVID-19; andWhereas the City\u2019s COVID-19 financial impacts projected up until December 31, 2020 surpassed the Phase 1 funding of the municipal operating stream after taking into consideration City-owned reserves and expenditure savings successfully mitigated;Therefore be it resolved:That, subject to Treasurer confirmation that eligibility criterion have been satisfied, Guelph City Council is seeking additional funding for Phase 2 of the municipal operating stream to support financial operating costs and pressures related to COVID-19.\""
